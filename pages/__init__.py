I suggest to create pages folders, where we can keep classes and methods for separate web pages. For sample,
we have web pages with different buckets, menu, we should write methods for every bucket/page.

In these samples we have mix of single page object concept (we keep locators in this page) and we take locators from
locators folder. Both concepts are in practice, just I prefer to keep locators in folder).

More about single page object concept:
